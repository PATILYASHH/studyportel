            <h2>1. B) Amplifiers and Oscillators</h2>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q1: How are amplifiers classified based on frequency response and Q-point?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Amplifiers are devices that boost weak electrical signals, and their classification depends on the frequency of signals they amplify (audio, radio, etc.) and how they operate based on the Q-point (operating point).</p>
                <p class="example">Think of an amplifier like a microphone. The microphone picks up your weak voice (low signal) and amplifies it so people in the back of the room can hear it clearly. Different types of microphones amplify different ranges of sound (low-frequency bass vs. high-pitched voices).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q2: What is the need for a multistage amplifier?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A multistage amplifier uses multiple amplifiers in sequence to increase both signal strength and clarity.</p>
                <p class="example">Imagine you are sending a message across a long distance by shouting. If you shout alone, people farther away may not hear clearly. Now, imagine several people standing in a line and each one shouts the message to the next, boosting the volume along the way. This is similar to what a multistage amplifier does for electrical signals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q3: What are coupling schemes, and why are they needed?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Coupling schemes connect different stages of an amplifier to pass signals between them while maintaining the signal quality.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of coupling like relay runners passing a baton. Different coupling methods (direct, RC, transformer) are like different ways to pass the baton efficiently so the team (amplifier) can continue running at full speed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q4: What is feedback in an amplifier?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Feedback in amplifiers means sending part of the output back into the input to control the behavior of the amplifier.</p>
                <p class="example">Imagine you’re adjusting the temperature in your room. If it’s too cold, you turn the heater up. If it gets too hot, you turn it down. That’s like <strong>negative feedback</strong>, which stabilizes the temperature (signal). <strong>Positive feedback</strong>, on the other hand, would be like turning the heat up more and more, making the room hotter and hotter—this can cause instability.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q5: What is the Barkhausen criterion for sustained oscillations?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Barkhausen criterion states that for an oscillator to keep generating a signal, the total feedback in the system must be equal to 1, and the total phase shift must be 0 or 360 degrees.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of a child on a swing. If you keep pushing the child at just the right time (feedback and phase shift), the swing will keep moving back and forth. If you stop pushing or push at the wrong time, the swinging stops. Similarly, oscillators need continuous and well-timed feedback to keep generating waves.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q6: What are the types of oscillators, and where are they used?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Oscillators generate periodic waveforms (like sine waves) used in various electronic devices.</p>
                <p class="example">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RC Phase Shift Oscillator:</strong> Like tapping a bell, where the bell keeps ringing (oscillating) for a short time after the tap. Used in audio devices like speakers.</li>
                        <li><strong>LC Colpitt’s Oscillator:</strong> Like plucking a guitar string that vibrates at a specific frequency, producing sound waves. Used in radio transmitters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cristal Oscillator:</strong> Like a tuning fork that vibrates at a precise frequency, producing a steady tone. Used in devices like watches and computers for precise timing.</li>
                    </ul>
