            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q1: What is the structure and working principle of a JFET?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A JFET (Junction Field Effect Transistor) controls the flow of current using an electric field created by the gate voltage.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of a water pipe (the channel) with a valve (the gate) that controls how much water flows. When the valve (gate voltage) is closed, no water (current) flows, but when it's partially opened, some water flows through the pipe (channel). The gate controls how much current flows between the source and drain.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q2: What are the I-V characteristics of a JFET?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> I-V characteristics describe how the current flowing through the JFET changes as the voltage applied across the device changes.</p>
                <p class="example">Imagine driving a car. At first, pressing the gas pedal (voltage) increases speed (current) linearly, but at some point, no matter how much you press the pedal, the car can't go any faster. This point in the JFET is called the pinch-off region, where the current remains constant despite increasing voltage.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q3: What are the important parameters of a JFET?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transconductance:</strong> Measures how much the current increases when you slightly change the gate voltage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drain Resistance:</strong> How much resistance the current faces between the drain and the source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pinch-off Voltage:</strong> The voltage at which the current stops increasing and stays constant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amplification Factor:</strong> Tells how well the JFET can amplify signals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example">If you think of the gate like a dimmer switch for lights, transconductance would tell you how sensitive the light is to small changes in the dimmer. Drain resistance is like how much the wiring in your house resists electricity flow.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q4: What are MOSFETs, and how are they different from JFETs?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FETs) are more advanced types of FETs that can handle more power and are widely used in modern electronics.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of MOSFETs as newer, better versions of water faucets. Instead of just opening and closing like a normal faucet (JFET), MOSFETs can be more precise, allowing tiny, exact amounts of water (current) to flow. That's why MOSFETs are used in modern electronics like computer processors.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q5: What are the applications of FETs in everyday life?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> FETs are used to control the flow of electrical signals in various devices.</p>
                <p class="example">FETs are like traffic lights for electricity. They manage when and how much current flows, which is crucial in devices like smartphones. FETs in your phone act like switches, turning circuits on and off, controlling everything from the brightness of your screen to your phone’s memory.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q6: Compare BJT, FET, and MOSFET with simple examples.</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor), FET, and MOSFET are different types of transistors used for switching and amplifying signals.</p>
                <p class="example">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>BJT:</strong> Think of a faucet where you have to manually turn the handle (current) to control the water flow. BJTs need a current to work.</li>
                        <li><strong>FET:</strong> Like an automatic faucet where you wave your hand to turn on the water (voltage control).</li>
                        <li><strong>MOSFET:</strong> Like a smart faucet that can adjust the water flow precisely, controlling both temperature and pressure with little effort.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. B) Amplifiers and Oscillators</h2>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q7: How are amplifiers classified based on frequency response and Q-point?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Amplifiers are devices that boost weak electrical signals, and their classification depends on the frequency of signals they amplify (audio, radio, etc.) and how they operate based on the Q-point (operating point).</p>
                <p class="example">Think of an amplifier like a microphone. The microphone picks up your weak voice (low signal) and amplifies it so people in the back of the room can hear it clearly. Different types of microphones amplify different ranges of sound (low-frequency bass vs. high-pitched voices).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q8: What is the need for a multistage amplifier?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A multistage amplifier uses multiple amplifiers in sequence to increase both signal strength and clarity.</p>
                <p class="example">Imagine you are sending a message across a long distance by shouting. If you shout alone, people farther away may not hear clearly. Now, imagine several people standing in a line and each one shouts the message to the next, boosting the volume along the way. This is similar to what a multistage amplifier does for electrical signals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q9: What are coupling schemes, and why are they needed?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Coupling schemes connect different stages of an amplifier to pass signals between them while maintaining the signal quality.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of coupling like relay runners passing a baton. Different coupling methods (direct, RC, transformer) are like different ways to pass the baton efficiently so the team (amplifier) can continue running at full speed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q10: What is feedback in an amplifier?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Feedback in amplifiers means sending part of the output back into the input to control the behavior of the amplifier.</p>
                <p class="example">Imagine you’re adjusting the temperature in your room. If it’s too cold, you turn the heater up. If it gets too hot, you turn it down. That’s like <strong>negative feedback</strong>, which stabilizes the temperature (signal). <strong>Positive feedback</strong>, on the other hand, would be like turning the heat up more and more, making the room hotter and hotter—this can cause instability.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q11: What is the Barkhausen criterion for sustained oscillations?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Barkhausen criterion states that for an oscillator to keep generating a signal, the total feedback in the system must be equal to 1, and the total phase shift must be 0 or 360 degrees.</p>
                <p class="example">Think of a child on a swing. If you keep pushing the child at just the right time (feedback and phase shift), the swing will keep moving back and forth. If you stop pushing or push at the wrong time, the swinging stops. Similarly, oscillators need continuous and well-timed feedback to keep generating waves.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q12: What are the types of oscillators, and where are they used?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Oscillators generate periodic waveforms (like sine waves) used in various electronic devices.</p>
                <p class="example">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RC Phase Shift Oscillator:</strong> Like tapping a bell, where the bell keeps ringing (oscillating) for a short time after the tap. Used in audio devices like speakers.</li>
                        <li><strong>LC Colpitt’s Oscillator:</strong> Like plucking a guitar string that vibrates at a specific frequency, producing sound waves. Used in radio transmitters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cristal Oscillator:</strong> Like a tuning fork that vibrates at a precise frequency, producing a steady tone. Used in devices like watches and computers for precise timing.</li>
                    </ul>
